  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magic ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We belive there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
    benefit from learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, probably more.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <h2>Founders</h2>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We belive that the kind of technical sophistication
    taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
    <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.
